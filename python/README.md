```shell
pip install git+https://github.roche.com/RAADC2019/submitRAADC2#subdirectory=python
```

## Command line usage

```shell
submitRAADC2 submit prediction.csv -v
```

## Python usage

You'll be generating a 2-column dataframe for your predictions. It should be formatted like `prediction_df` here (note: the name of your dataframe object doesn't matter).
```
import pandas as pd
import submitRAADC2
patient_ids = submitRAADC2.submit.patient_ids()
subgroups = pd.np.repeat(['Tecentriq', 'Chemo'], [500, 500]).tolist()
prediction_df = pd.DataFrame(
    {"PatientID": patient_ids,
     "RespondingSubgroup": subgroups
    }
)
prediction_df.head()
```

```
     PatientID  RespondingSubgroup
0  RAADCV00001  Tecentriq
1  RAADCV00003  Tecentriq
2  RAADCV00004  Tecentriq
3  RAADCV00005  Tecentriq
4  RAADCV00007  Tecentriq
```

To check your predictions for any formatting errors, run the following command:
```r
submitRAADC2.submit_raadc2(prediction_df, validate_only=True)
```

When you're ready to submit your prediction to the RAAD Challenge evaluation queue, simply run this command:
```
submitRAADC2.submit_raadc2(prediction_df)
```

Note, this is an equivalent way to import an use the function:
```
from submitRAADC2 import submit_raadc2
submit_raadc2(prediction_df)
```

You'll be guided through a series with progress messages and prompts. A typical workflow for a first-time user would look like this:

```
Running checks to validate date frame format...

All checks passed.
