## Overview

The **submitRAADC2** wraps the Synapse R client with convenience functions for submitting predictions to the challenge evaluation queue.


## Installation

```r
devtools::install_github(
  "RAADC2019/submitRAADC2", 
  subdir = "R"
)
```

Alternatively, use these steps in the terminal to install the package:
```

git clone https://github.roche.com/RAADC2019/submitRAADC2
cd submitRAADC2/R
Rscript -e 'devtools::install()'
```

**Note:** This package uses the [**getRAADC2**](https://github.roche.com/RAADC2019/getRAADC2) package for functions related to validating data.

The **`submitRAADC2`** package should be loaded by default when you start a R new session in the **Portable Analytics** platform. If not, use this command to get started:
```r
library(submitRAADC2)
```

### Requirements

...

## Usage

You'll be generating a 2-column dataframe for your predictions. It should be formatted like `d_predictions` here (note: the name of your dataframe object doesn't matter).
```r
set.seed(2018)
d_predictions <- data.frame(
  PatientID = submitRAADC2::patient_ids,
  RespondingSubgroup = rep(c("Tecentriq","Chemo"), 500)
)
head(d_predictions)
```

```
    PatientID RespondingSubgroup
1 RAADCV00001 Tecentriq
2 RAADCV00003     Chemo
3 RAADCV00004 Tecentriq
4 RAADCV00005     Chemo
5 RAADCV00006 Tecentriq
6 RAADCV00007     Chemo
```

To check your predictions for any formatting errors, run the following command:
```r
submit_raadc2(d_predictions, validate_only = TRUE)
```

If any errors are found, you'll see a message that looks like this:
```
Running checks to validate data frame format...

 Error in getRAADC2::validate_predictions(predictions) : 
  Predictions not of the format PatientID,RespondingSubgroup 
```

Otherwise, you should see:
```
Running checks to validate data frame format...

All checks passed.
```

When you're ready to submit your prediction to the RAAD Challenge evaluation queue, simply run this command:
```r
submit_raadc2(d_predictions)
```

You'll be guided through a series with progress messages and prompts. A typical workflow for a first-time user would look like this:

```
Running checks to validate data frame format...

All checks passed.

Checking ability to submit...

 > Team: Your team, RAAD2 ADTest, is eligible to submit.
 > User: You're eligible to submit for your team.

Each team is allotted a total of THREE valid submissions to the challenge. 
You can submit anytime between February 19th and March 15th â€” it's up to
you and your team to decide when to submit predictions within the open
window. You will be able to see your score on the leaderboard only for your
FIRST TWO submissions. Once your team has reached its quota, you will not 
be able to submit again. 

Are you sure you want to submit?
